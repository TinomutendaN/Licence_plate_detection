# LICENCE PLATE AUTO DETECTION SYSTEM

### Overview
###### The License Plate Automatic Detector is a custom-trained model designed to automatically detect and read vehicle license plates. This project utilizes a Yolov8 pre-trained model for vehicle detection and a separate license plate detector trained using Yolov8 on a custom dataset.

### Features
###### Vehicle Detection: Identifies vehicles in images using a Yolov8 pre-trained model.
###### License Plate Detection: Detects license plates from the identified vehicles using a custom-trained Yolov8 model.

#### Dependencies
###### To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

###### Yolov8: For training and inference with the object detection model.
###### Sort Module: Required for tracking objects. Download from the SORT repository.
